This repository contains  3D point transformations and visualizing the results.
It includes functionalities for parsing 3D model data, applying various transformations (translation, rotation, scaling),
made for integrating with external simulation environments like CoppeliaSim (formerly V-REP) for real-time visualization and interaction. 

- Fundamental 3D point transformations (translation, rotation, scaling).
- To parse and process 3D model data from text files.
- To visualize transformed 3D points, potentially within a simulated environment.
